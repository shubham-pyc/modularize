# Modularize

Modularize is a Python utility for breaking down large code files into smaller, more manageable modules. It helps improve code organization, readability, and maintainability by promoting modular design principles.

## Features

- Split large Python files into smaller modules based on functions, classes, and constants.
- Automatically generate import statements for dependencies between modules.
- Organize and refactor code to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/modularize.git
cd modularize
```

### Usage

1. Place your large Python file (e.g., `main.py`) in the project directory.

2. Run the script with the following command, providing the input filename as an argument:

```bash
python modularize.py main.py
```
